[**Aspose.Slides for Python via Java**](/slides/python-java/) can load a PowerPoint Open XML template (`POTX`), render its slides, and save each rendered slide as a `BMP` image. The conversion does not require Microsoft PowerPoint.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert POTX to BMP using Python" %}}
Create a `Presentation` from the POTX file, access each slide through a variable, call `getImage`, and save the rendered image with `ImageFormat.Bmp`.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Python code for converting POTX slides to BMP" offSpacer="true" %}}

```python
presentation = Presentation("presentation.potx")
try:
    slide_count = presentation.getSlides().size()

    for slide_index in range(slide_count):
        slide = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(slide_index)
        slide_image = slide.getImage(2, 2)
        try:
            file_path = f"slide-{slide_index + 1}.bmp"
            slide_image.save(file_path, ImageFormat.Bmp)
        finally:
            slide_image.dispose()
finally:
    presentation.dispose()
```

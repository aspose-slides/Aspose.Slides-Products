[**Aspose.Slides for Python via Java**](/slides/python-java/) can import PDF pages as slides and export their visual content to an HTML document that can be opened in a web browser. The conversion does not require Microsoft PowerPoint or a PDF viewer.

Create an empty `Presentation`, remove its default slide, and call `addFromPdf` to import the PDF pages. Then call `save` with `SaveFormat.Html` to generate an HTML document.

[**Aspose.Slides for Python via Java**](/slides/python-java/) can load an OTP presentation template, render each slide, and save the rendered content as a PNG image. This produces one image per slide and does not require Microsoft PowerPoint, LibreOffice, or OpenOffice.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Convert OTP to PNG using Python" %}}
Create a `Presentation` from the OTP file, access each slide through a variable, call `getImage`, and save the rendered image with `ImageFormat.Png`.

```python
presentation = Presentation("presentation.otp")
try:
    slide_count = presentation.getSlides().size()

    for slide_index in range(slide_count):
        slide = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(slide_index)
        slide_image = slide.getImage(2, 2)
        try:
            file_path = f"slide-{slide_index + 1}.png"
            slide_image.save(file_path, ImageFormat.Png)
        finally:
            slide_image.dispose()
finally:
    presentation.dispose()
```

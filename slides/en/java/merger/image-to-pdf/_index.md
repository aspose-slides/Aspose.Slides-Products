[Aspose.Slides for Java](/slides/java/) is a Java API for creating, editing, converting, and merging presentation content. You can place images into a `Presentation` and save the combined slide as a `PDF` file.

Using [Aspose.Slides for Java](/slides/java/), you can merge images and create a `PDF` result with a few lines of Java code.

```java
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
try {
    ISlide slide = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0);

    byte[] firstImageData = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("image1.png"));
    IPPImage firstImage = presentation.getImages().addImage(firstImageData);
    slide.getShapes().addPictureFrame(ShapeType.Rectangle, 0, 0, 100, 100, firstImage);

    byte[] secondImageData = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("image2.png"));
    IPPImage secondImage = presentation.getImages().addImage(secondImageData);
    slide.getShapes().addPictureFrame(ShapeType.Rectangle, 0, 200, 100, 100, secondImage);

    presentation.save("merged.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);
} finally {
    presentation.dispose();
}

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section h2="Supported File Formats" %}}

Aspose.Slides for C++ can work with a wide range of file formats for PowerPoint presentations, such as:

- **Input formats**: PPT, PPTX, PDF, ODP, OTP, POT, POTM, POTX, PPS, PPSM, PPSX, PPTM, FODP, and more.
- **Output formats**: PPTX, PPT, PDF, HTML, PNG, BMP, JPG, FODP, GIF, ODP, OTP, POT, POTM, POTX, PPS, PPSM, PPSX, PPTM, SVG, TIFF, and more.

You can also convert presentations to and from streams and byte arrays.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section h2="Export Powerpoint files to PDF" %}}

[**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) is a powerful C++ library for creating and manipulating presentation files. Moreover, it provides flexible ways to convert presentation to PDF. Using **Aspose.Slides for C++**, any developer or application can convert Powerpoint presentation to PDF file with just a few lines of C++ code.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C++ code for converting presentation to PDF" offSpacer="true" %}}

```cpp
// Load the PPT.
SharedPtr<Presentation> presentation = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"presentation.ppt");
// Save in PDF format.
presentation->Save(u"document.pdf", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pdf);

```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section h2="Add animation to presentation" %}}

Adding animation to presentation elements can make it more interactive and engaging for viewers.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C++ code for adding animation to TextBox" offSpacer="true" %}}

```cpp
// Instantiates a presentation class that represents a presentation file.
System::SharedPtr<Presentation> pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();

System::SharedPtr<ISlide> sld = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);

// Adds new AutoShape with text
System::SharedPtr<IAutoShape> autoShape =
    sld->get_Shapes()->AddAutoShape(Aspose::Slides::ShapeType::Rectangle, 20.0f, 20.0f, 150.0f, 100.0f);

System::SharedPtr<ITextFrame> textFrame = autoShape->get_TextFrame();
textFrame->set_Text(u"First paragraph \nSecond paragraph \n Third paragraph");

// Gets the main sequence of the slide.
System::SharedPtr<ISequence> sequence = sld->get_Timeline()->get_MainSequence();

// Adds Fade animation effect to shape
System::SharedPtr<IEffect> effect = sequence->AddEffect(autoShape, Aspose::Slides::Animation::EffectType::Fade,
    Aspose::Slides::Animation::EffectSubtype::None, Aspose::Slides::Animation::EffectTriggerType::OnClick);

// Animates shape text by 1st level paragraphs
effect->get_TextAnimation()->set_BuildType(Aspose::Slides::Animation::BuildType::ByLevelParagraphs1);

// Save the PPTX file to disk
pres->Save(path + u"AnimText_out.pptx", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pptx);

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section h2="Save Powerpoint slides to Images" %}}

In certain scenarios, it may be required to transform the entire presentation into a collection of images, which is possible using **Aspose.Slides for C++**. 

Converting a presentation to a set of images can be useful in several ways. For instance, it can help reduce the file size of the presentation, making it easier to share and store. Additionally, it can help ensure that the presentation appears the same way on different devices and platforms. Converting presentations to images can also be helpful when you want to include slides in documents or web pages that don't support PowerPoint files. Finally, converting presentations to images can be useful when you want to create a video from your presentation.

The C++ code demonstrates how to convert a presentation to JPG images.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C++ code for converting presentation to JPG with custom scale" offSpacer="true" %}}

```cpp
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PowerPoint-Presentation.pptx");

// Defines dimensions
int32_t desiredX = 1200, desiredY = 800;
// Gets scaled values of X and Y
float ScaleX = (float)(1.0 / pres->get_SlideSize()->get_Size().get_Width()) * desiredX;
float ScaleY = (float)(1.0 / pres->get_SlideSize()->get_Size().get_Height()) * desiredY;

for (auto&& sld : pres->get_Slides())
{
    // Creates a full scale image
    System::SharedPtr<System::Drawing::Bitmap> bmp = sld->GetThumbnail(ScaleX, ScaleY);

    // Saves the image to disk in JPEG format
    bmp->Save(System::String::Format(u"Slide_{0}.jpg", sld->get_SlideNumber()),
              System::Drawing::Imaging::ImageFormat::get_Jpeg());
}

```

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section h2="Convert presentation to video" %}}

Converting PowerPoint presentations to videos can be done using the **Aspose.Slides for C++** API

Converting a presentation to a video format can be beneficial in several ways. Firstly, it makes the presentation more accessible to a wider audience, as videos can be played on various devices and platforms without the need for PowerPoint software. Secondly, videos are easier to share than PowerPoint files, as they can be uploaded to video-sharing platforms like YouTube. Thirdly, videos can be embedded in websites and blogs, making it easier to share presentations with a larger audience. Fourthly, videos can be used for training purposes, as they can be paused and rewound to review specific sections of the presentation. Finally, videos can help make presentations more engaging by adding animations, transitions, and background music.


{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C++ code for converting presentation to video" offSpacer="true" %}}

```cpp
void OnFrameTick(System::SharedPtr<PresentationPlayer> sender, System::SharedPtr<FrameTickEventArgs> args)
{
    System::String fileName = System::String::Format(u"frame_{0}.png", sender->get_FrameIndex());
    args->GetFrame()->Save(fileName);
}

void Run()
{
    auto presentation = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(u"PowerPoint-Presentation.pptx");

    const int32_t fps = 33;

    auto animationsGenerator = System::MakeObject<PresentationAnimationsGenerator>(presentation);
    auto player = System::MakeObject<PresentationPlayer>(animationsGenerator, fps);
    player->FrameTick += OnFrameTick;
    animationsGenerator->Run(presentation->get_Slides());

    const System::String ffmpegParameters = System::String::Format(
        u"-loglevel {0} -framerate {1} -i {2} -y -c:v {3} -pix_fmt {4} {5}",
        u"warning", m_fps, "frame_%d.png", u"libx264", u"yuv420p", "video.mp4");
    auto ffmpegProcess = System::Diagnostics::Process::Start(u"ffmpeg", ffmpegParameters);
    ffmpegProcess->WaitForExit();
}

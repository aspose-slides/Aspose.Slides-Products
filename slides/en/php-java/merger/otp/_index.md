[**Aspose.Slides for PHP via Java**](/slides/php-java/) can combine multiple OTP presentations into one file. The API clones slides from each source presentation into a destination presentation while retaining their content and formatting.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Merge OTP files using PHP" %}}
To merge OTP presentations, load both files, clone each source slide into the destination presentation with `addClone`, and save the result in OTP format.

```php
$destinationPresentation = new Presentation("document1.otp");
$sourcePresentation = new Presentation("document2.otp");
try {
    $slideCount = java_values($sourcePresentation->getSlides()->size());

    for ($slideIndex = 0; $slideIndex < $slideCount; $slideIndex++) {
        $slide = $sourcePresentation->getSlides()->get_Item($slideIndex);
        $destinationPresentation->getSlides()->addClone($slide);
    }

    $destinationPresentation->save("merged.otp", SaveFormat::Otp);
} finally {
    $sourcePresentation->dispose();
    $destinationPresentation->dispose();
}
```

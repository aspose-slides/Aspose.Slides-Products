[**Aspose.Slides for PHP via Java**](/slides/php-java/) can load, modify, and save PPTX presentations. You can edit slide text, add shapes and images, update formatting, and work with other presentation elements through the API.

The following example loads a PPTX presentation, adds a rectangle containing text to its first slide, and saves the modified presentation as a new PPTX file.

```php
$presentation = new Presentation("input.pptx");
try {
    $slide = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0);
    $shape = $slide->getShapes()->addAutoShape(
        ShapeType::Rectangle, 10, 10, 100, 50);
    $shape->getTextFrame()->setText("New text");

    $presentation->save("output.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
} finally {
    $presentation->dispose();
}
```

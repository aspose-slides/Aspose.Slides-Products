[**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](/slides/python-net/) lets you combine multiple PPSM presentations by cloning slides from one `Presentation` into another. The `SlideCollection.add_clone` method preserves the content and formatting of each cloned slide. You can then render every `Slide` in the merged `Presentation` with `Slide.get_image` and save the resulting `IImage` object in JPEG format.

Load one PPSM file as the destination presentation, clone the slides from another PPSM file into it, and render the merged slides as separate JPG images.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Python code to merge PPSM files and export to JPG" offSpacer="true" %}}

```python
image_scale = 2

with slides.Presentation("destination.ppsm") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("source.ppsm") as source_presentation:
        for source_slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(source_slide)

    for slide in destination_presentation.slides:
        file_path = f"merged_slide_{slide.slide_number}.jpg"

        with slide.get_image(image_scale, image_scale) as slide_image:
            slide_image.save(file_path, slides.ImageFormat.JPEG)
```

Install [**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](/slides/python-net/) with `pip install aspose-slides`.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Make the `aspose.slides` namespace available in your Python project.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Open the destination and source PPSM files as `Presentation` instances.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Iterate through the source slides and call [`SlideCollection.add_clone`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidecollection/add_clone/) for each `Slide`.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Render each merged `Slide` with `Slide.get_image`, then call `IImage.save` with `ImageFormat.JPEG` to create a separate JPG file for that slide.

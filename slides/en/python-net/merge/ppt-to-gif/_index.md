[**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge PPT presentations by cloning slides from a source `Presentation` into a destination `Presentation`. The cloned slides retain their layouts, shapes, styles, text, formatting, comments, and animations. Save the destination presentation with `SaveFormat.GIF` to export its slides as animation frames in one GIF file.

Clone each source slide with `add_clone`, then call `save` with `SaveFormat.GIF`.

```python
with slides.Presentation("presentation1.ppt") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("presentation2.ppt") as source_presentation:
        for slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(slide)

    destination_presentation.save("merged_presentation.gif", slides.export.SaveFormat.GIF)
```

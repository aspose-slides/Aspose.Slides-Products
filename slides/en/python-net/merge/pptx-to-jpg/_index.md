[*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge PowerPoint PPTX files by cloning slides from one presentation into another. After combining the slides with `SlideCollection.add_clone`, render each slide with `Slide.get_image` and save the resulting `IImage` object in JPEG format.

Open the destination and source PPTX presentations, append a clone of each source slide, and render every slide in the merged presentation as a separate JPEG image.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Python code for merging PPTX files and exporting the slides as JPG images" offSpacer="true" %}}

```python
image_scale = 2

with slides.Presentation("destination.pptx") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("source.pptx") as source_presentation:
        for slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(slide)

    for slide in destination_presentation.slides:
        file_path = f"merged_slide_{slide.slide_number}.jpg"
        with slide.get_image(image_scale, image_scale) as slide_image:
            slide_image.save(file_path, slides.ImageFormat.JPEG)
```

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Install the `aspose-slides` package by following the [Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET installation guide](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/python-net/installation/).
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Make the `aspose.slides` namespace available in your Python project.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Open the destination and source PPTX files as `Presentation` instances.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Iterate through the source slides and call [`SlideCollection.add_clone`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidecollection/add_clone/) for each slide.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Render each merged slide with `Slide.get_image`, then call `IImage.save` with `ImageFormat.JPEG` to create a separate JPG file for that slide.

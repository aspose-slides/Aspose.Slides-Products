[*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge PowerPoint Macro-Enabled Template (POTM) files by cloning slides from one `Presentation` into another. After combining the slides with `SlideCollection.add_clone`, export each slide with `Slide.write_as_svg` to create a separate SVG image.

Open the destination and source POTM files, append a clone of each source slide, and export every slide in the merged presentation as a separate SVG image.

```python
with slides.Presentation("destination.potm") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("source.potm") as source_presentation:
        for source_slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(source_slide)

    for slide in destination_presentation.slides:
        file_path = f"merged_slide_{slide.slide_number}.svg"
        with open(file_path, "wb") as output_stream:
            slide.write_as_svg(output_stream)
```

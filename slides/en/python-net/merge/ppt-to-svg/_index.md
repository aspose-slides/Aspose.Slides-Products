[*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge PowerPoint 97–2003 Presentation (PPT) files by cloning slides from one presentation into another. After combining the slides with `SlideCollection.add_clone`, call `Slide.write_as_svg` to export each merged slide as a separate SVG image.

Open the destination and source PPT presentations, append a clone of each source slide, and render every slide in the merged presentation as a separate SVG image.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Python code for merging PPT files and exporting the slides as SVG images" offSpacer="true" %}}

```python
with slides.Presentation("destination.ppt") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("source.ppt") as source_presentation:
        for slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(slide)

    for slide in destination_presentation.slides:
        file_path = f"merged-slide-{slide.slide_number}.svg"
        with open(file_path, "wb") as output_stream:
            slide.write_as_svg(output_stream)
```

Install Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET by following the [installation guide](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/python-net/installation/).
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Make the `aspose.slides` namespace available in your Python project.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Open the destination and source PPT files as `Presentation` instances.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Iterate through the source slides and call [`SlideCollection.add_clone`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidecollection/) for each slide.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
For each merged slide, open a binary output stream and call [`Slide.write_as_svg`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slide/write_as_svg/) to create a separate SVG file.

[*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge PowerPoint PPTX files by cloning slides from one presentation into another. After combining the slides with `SlideCollection.add_clone`, call `Presentation.save` with `SaveFormat.HTML5` to export the merged presentation as an HTML5 document.

Open the destination and source PPTX presentations, append a clone of each source slide, and save the merged presentation as HTML5.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Python code for merging PPTX files into an HTML5 document" offSpacer="true" %}}

```python
with slides.Presentation("destination.pptx") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("source.pptx") as source_presentation:
        for slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(slide)

    destination_presentation.save("merged-presentation.html", slides.export.SaveFormat.HTML5)
```

[*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge POT presentation files by cloning slides from one `Presentation` into another. `SlideCollection.add_clone` copies each source slide into the destination presentation, including its content and formatting.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Merge POT Files Using Python" %}}
Open the destination and source POT files, append a clone of each source slide, and save the combined presentation as a POT file.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Python code for merging POT files into a single POT file" offSpacer="true" %}}


```python
with slides.Presentation("destination.pot") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("source.pot") as source_presentation:
        for slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(slide)

    destination_presentation.save("merged.pot", slides.export.SaveFormat.POT)
```

Install Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET by following the [installation guide](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/python-net/installation/).
```console
pip install aspose-slides
```
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Make the `aspose.slides` namespace available in your Python project.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Open the destination and source POT files as `Presentation` instances.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Iterate through the source slides and call [`SlideCollection.add_clone`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidecollection/add_clone/) for each slide.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Call `Presentation.save` with `SaveFormat.POT` to write the merged presentation to a single POT file.

[*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge PowerPoint PPTX files by cloning slides from one presentation into another. After combining the slides with `SlideCollection.add_clone`, call `Presentation.save` with `SaveFormat.PDF` to export the merged slides as a single PDF document.

Open the destination and source PPTX presentations, append a clone of each source slide, and export the merged presentation as a single PDF document.

```python
with slides.Presentation("destination.pptx") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("source.pptx") as source_presentation:
        for slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(slide)

    destination_presentation.save("merged-presentation.pdf", slides.export.SaveFormat.PDF)

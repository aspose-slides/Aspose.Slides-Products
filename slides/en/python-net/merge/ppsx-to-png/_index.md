[**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge PPSX files by cloning slides from a source `Presentation` into a destination `Presentation`. After combining the slides with `SlideCollection.add_clone`, call `Slide.get_image` and save each resulting `IImage` with `ImageFormat.PNG`.

Open the destination and source PPSX presentations, append a clone of each source slide, and render every slide in the merged presentation as a separate PNG image.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Python code to merge PPSX files and export slides to PNG" offSpacer="true" %}}

```python
image_scale = 2

with slides.Presentation("presentation1.ppsx") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("presentation2.ppsx") as source_presentation:
        for slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(slide)

    for slide in destination_presentation.slides:
        file_path = f"merged-presentation-slide-{slide.slide_number}.png"

        with slide.get_image(image_scale, image_scale) as slide_image:
            slide_image.save(file_path, slides.ImageFormat.PNG)
```

Install [**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](/slides/python-net/) by following the [installation guide](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/python-net/installation/).
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Make the `aspose.slides` namespace available as `slides` in your Python project.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Open the destination and source PPSX files as `Presentation` instances.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Iterate through the source slides and call [`SlideCollection.add_clone`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slidecollection/add_clone/) for each `Slide`.
{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/step-autogen %}}
Render each merged `Slide` with [`Slide.get_image`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/slide/get_image/), then call `IImage.save` with `ImageFormat.PNG` to create a separate PNG file for that slide.

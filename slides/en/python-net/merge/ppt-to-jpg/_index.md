[**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge PPT presentations by cloning slides from a source `Presentation` into a destination `Presentation`. The cloned slides retain their layouts, shapes, styles, text, formatting, comments, and animations. After merging, call `get_image` for each slide and save the rendered image with `ImageFormat.JPEG`.

Clone each source slide with `add_clone`, then render and save every slide in the merged presentation as a JPG image.

```python
image_scale = 2

with slides.Presentation("presentation1.ppt") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("presentation2.ppt") as source_presentation:
        for slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(slide)

    for slide in destination_presentation.slides:
        file_path = f"merged_slide_{slide.slide_number}.jpg"
        with slide.get_image(image_scale, image_scale) as slide_image:
            slide_image.save(file_path, slides.ImageFormat.JPEG)
```

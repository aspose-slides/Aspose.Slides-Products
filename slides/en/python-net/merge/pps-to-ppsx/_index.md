[*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge PowerPoint Slide Show (PPS) files by cloning slides from one presentation into another. After combining the slides with `ISlideCollection.add_clone`, call `Presentation.save` with `SaveFormat.PPSX` to save the merged slides as a single PPSX presentation.

Open the destination and source PPS presentations, append a clone of each source slide, and save the merged presentation as a PPSX file.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Python code for merging PPS files into a single PPSX presentation" offSpacer="true" %}}

```python
with slides.Presentation("destination.pps") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("source.pps") as source_presentation:
        for slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(slide)

    destination_presentation.save("merged-presentation.ppsx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPSX)
```

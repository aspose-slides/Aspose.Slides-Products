[*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge PowerPoint Open XML Slide Show (PPSX) files by cloning slides from one presentation into another. After combining the slides with `SlideCollection.add_clone`, call `Presentation.save` with `SaveFormat.PPS` to write the merged presentation as a PowerPoint 97-2003 slide show.

Open the destination and source PPSX presentations, append a clone of each source slide, and save the merged presentation as a single PPS file.

```python
with slides.Presentation("destination.ppsx") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("source.ppsx") as source_presentation:
        for slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(slide)

    destination_presentation.save("merged-presentation.pps", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPS)
```

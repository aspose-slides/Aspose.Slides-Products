[*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](/slides/python-net/) lets you merge PowerPoint Slide Show (PPS) files by cloning slides from one `Presentation` into another. After combining the slides with `SlideCollection.add_clone`, call `Presentation.save` with `SaveFormat.GIF` to export the merged presentation as an animated GIF.

Open the destination and source PPS files, append a clone of each source slide, and save the merged presentation as an animated GIF.

```python
with slides.Presentation("destination.pps") as destination_presentation:
    with slides.Presentation("source.pps") as source_presentation:
        for source_slide in source_presentation.slides:
            destination_presentation.slides.add_clone(source_slide)

    destination_presentation.save("merged_presentation.gif", slides.export.SaveFormat.GIF)
```
